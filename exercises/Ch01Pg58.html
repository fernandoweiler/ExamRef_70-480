            <td>You were hired to create a game. For the first stage of the game, you must make a
ball move from the left side of the screen to right side. How can you achieve this
with the HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; element? How about with SVG? You demonstrate this
stage to stakeholders, and they love it. For the next stage, when the ball is clicked, it
must split into two balls. As the number of balls increases due to being clicked, what
considerations need to be taken into account? Would using SVG or the &lt;canvas&gt;
element be the better solution for this game?</td>
